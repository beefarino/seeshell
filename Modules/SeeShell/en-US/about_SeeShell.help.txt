SHORT DESCRIPTION

    SeeShell is a simple data visualization module for PowerShell
    that currently supports Charts.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    SeeShell brings data visualization capabilities to your PowerShell and ISE
    sessions.  SeeShell visualizations can monitor data sources asynchronously,
    allowing you to perform other tasks in your PowerShell session.

    SeeShell supports the following features:

  Graphing and Charting

    SeeShell supports over two dozen types of charts.  These include linear and
    radial plots capable of displaying relationships between quantitative and
    qualitiative data.  In addition, a single chart can display multiple
    independent sources of data, sharing axes where appropriate.

    For more information type:

	get-help about_SeeShell_Charts
  get-help out-chart

  Data Sources

    Use SeeShell data sources to define and describe your data.  Describe the
    properties of each data item, including scale information, key data ranges
    to reflect in the visualizations, and visualization colors.

USING SEESHELL

  Prerequisites

    SeeShell requires the following to operate:
      * PowerShell 3.0 or higher
      * .NET Framework 4.5

  Loading SeeShell

    SeeShell is distributed as a module.  Before you can use SeeShell cmdlets,
    you need to import the SeeShell module into your session using the
    import-module cmdlet:

      import-module seeshell


GETTING STARTED

    Once the module is loaded, the list of cmdlets available in SeeShell can be
    found using:

      get-command -module seeshell

    For help on a specific SeeShell cmdlet, use the standard get-help
    PowerShell cmdlet:

      get-help out-chart

QUICK EXAMPLE

    1) Open a PowerShell console.
    2) Import the SeeShell module by following the instructions in USING SEESHELL.
    3) In the PowerShell console, type the following:

	dir | out-chart -name Files -type Column -plot Length -by Name

	This will plot the size of each file (in bytes) by the file name for all
	files in the current directory.
