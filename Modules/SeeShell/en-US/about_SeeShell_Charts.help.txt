SHORT DESCRIPTION
    SeeShell provides over two dozen types of charts for your data
    visualization needs.
    
    SeeShell allows you to overlay multiple charts with independent
    series of data into a single visualization.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    SeeShell provides over two dozen types of charts for your data
    visualization needs.  Each available chart series can be classified
    in two ways:

      * SHAPE 
      * X AXIS DATA TYPE
        
    SHAPE
    
    A chart can be either LINEAR or RADIAL in shape.  
        
    LINEAR charts display as traditional Cartesean plots, with an X axis
    that runs horizontally and a Y axis that runs vertically.
        
    RADIAL charts display as circular plots, with an X axis that
    corresponds to an angle in the plot and a Y axis that corresponds to
    a radius on the plot.
        
    SeeShell can overlay chart series of the same shape into a single
    chart, so that axes are shared where possible and the plot area is
    synchronized across data sources.  SeeShell cannot combine linear
    and radial chart series into a single chart, since the axes layout
    is so different between the two shapes.
        
    X AXIS DATA TYPE The X Axis of a chart series can be classified as
    one of three data types:
	   
       * CATEGORY data 
       * NUMERIC data 
       * ANGLE data
            
    CATEGORY data is qualitative in nature.  A data item either belongs
    to a particular category or it does not, and it cannot belong to
    more than one category in the same series.  Examples of categorical
    data include:

	* names 
	* id numbers 
	* dates and times 
	* letter grades

    NUMERIC data is quantitative in nature.  That is, is represents a
    continuum of possible values.  Examples of numeric data include:

	* age
	* cost
	* count                    
	* population
	* percentages

    ANGLE data is a subset of numeric data that describes an angle.  In
    particular, the value of the angle must be between 0.0 and 360.0.


    AVAILABLE CHART SERIES TYPES

    The following table defines each available chart series type name,
    and includes the series shape and X Axis data type classification.

        |  RadialArea       | radial     | category  |
        |  RadialColumn     | radial     | category  |
        |  RadialLine       | radial     | category  |
        |  RadialPie        | radial     | category  |
        |                   |            |           |
        |  Bubble           | linear     | numeric   |
        |  ScatterLine      | linear     | numeric   |
        |  Scatter          | linear     | numeric   |
        |  ScatterSpline    | linear     | numeric   |
        |                   |            |           |
        |  Timeline[*]      | linear     | datetime  |
        +-------------------+------------+-----------+    
        
        [*] the Timeline series is a special case that 
	can ONLY be used when the following conditions exist: 
	    1) the chart already contains a series that is LINEAR and
		CATEGORICAL 
	    2) the existing series identified in (1) has an
		X Axis based on the DateTime datatype.

    DATA SERIES COLOR AND SCALE SUPPORT
    
    All chart visualizations use the color assigned to data series as
    the primary chart series color.  For instance, the columns of a
    column series plot will be drawn in the color assigned to the data
    series being plotted.

    Chart visualizations use scale names to share axes where possible.
    If two data series use the same scale name, it is assumed they
    should be plotted to the same axis.  If the series use different
    scale names (or no scale names), it is assumed they should be
    plotted to unique axes.

    Scale ranges are drawn in chart visualizations as marker lines on
    the Y Axis values representing the bottom of the range.  For
    example, an orange scale range from 65 to 90 will result in an
    orange marker line at the value 65 on the Y Axis for the series.

EXAMPLES

 -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------

 C:\PS>dir ~ | out-chart -name HomeFiles -type Column -plot Length -by Name


 Description
 -----------
 This example plots the size of each file in your home folder as a
 column chart.


 -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------

 C:\PS>dir ~ | out-chart -name FileSizeAndLines -type Column `
     -plot Length,{$_ | get-content | measure -line | select -exp Lines}`
     -by Name


 Description
 -----------
 This example plots two series of data based on the files in your home
 folder.  The first series is the length of each file, and the second is
 the line count of each file.

 -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------

 C:\PS>{ get-counter '\processors(0)\% processor time' -continuous `
     | select -expand CounterSamples } | `
     out-chart -name CPU -type Spline -plot CookedValue -by Timestamp


 Description
 -----------
 This example monitors total CPU processor time in a spline graph.  The
 graph will continue to update until the PowerShell session is ended.

 The get-counter cmdlet returns a collection of timestamped performance
 counter samples.  These samples are contained in the CounterSamples
 property of each sample set.
 
 For details on the data being plotted, try running the data source
 pipeline components on their own:
 
   get-counter '\processors(_total)\% processor time' -continuous
   
   get-counter '\processors(_total)\% processor time' -continuous |
       select -expand CounterSamples
